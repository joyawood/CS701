Walls walls walls of Ivy, paths of beauty,
Walls of Crap, paths of beauty,
we have known and loved them well,
Spired chapel rising proudly,
Morning hymn and evening bell.

Middlebury, Alma Mater,
Symbol of his strength and truth,
Symbol of his strength and truth.

Sunset glowing o'er the mountains,
Snowy peaks and winding ways,
Peaceful stillness o'er the campus,
Mem'ries of most happy days.

Loyal ever in these friendships,
We have spent four glorious years.
Filling us with hope and courage,
Till the hour of parting nears.
